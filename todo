Ideas?
	Create basic GUI widgets and create a debugging GUI, which will eventually
	be made into a map making GUI.
	
	Ensure that the visible area of the window remains consistent, meaning
	that sprites would have to be resized by a factor to keep the viewport
	consistent. Not totally required for some games, but for GUIs it is a must.

	Modify OveralyElement to make sure that sprites within the element are 
	only rendered within the size of the element, meaning it will get cut off
	if it extends passed the bounds of the element

	Since rotation has been added, hitbox management is needed. Create a hitbox
	class of sorts that can hold all sorts of hitboxes i gguess?
