# Basic-SDL-Game-Engine

Just a hobby project I did a few years back, a very basic game engine with a basic physics engine. Left click to spawn, WASD to move, SPACE to jump, and B to spawn physics balls. O key will show some basic debugging information.
NOTE: It will crash if you attempt to move before spawning.


# Building

$ make

The executable will be in bin/test


# Dependencies
